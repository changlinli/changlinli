# Hi I'm Changlin Li

I'm interested in solving problems in formal reasoning and AI safety. If need be, I write code to try solve them.

I have participated in two batches of Recurse Center. Once in the summer/fall of 2019 and once in the summer/fall of 2023.

At the moment, relevant to things on GitHub, I'm studying:

1. Mechanistic interpretability for AI
2. Proving things using formal proof assistants

And as some fun side projects:

1. Working on a fork of the Elm compiler
